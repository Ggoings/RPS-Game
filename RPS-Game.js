The game is Rock, Paper, Sissors.

The user selects which hand they will make, computer generates a random pick, then the two choices will determine the outcome. 
Then will displaying the winner and loser or if there was a tie.

How this works is if the user choice is greater then the computers choice then it will display that the winner is the user. 
If the users choice is lower then the computers choice then it will display that the user has lost. 
But if the users choice equals the computers choice then the game is a tie and will ask to try again.
